# The Characteristics of a Tennis Match Winner
The origins of tennis can be traced back to 12th century France, where it was referred to as “jeu de paume” (game of the palm), due to the usage of palms to hit the tennis ball instead of a traditional racket (“History of Tennis”). Today, it is a popular pastime enjoyed all around the globe by people of all ages. Top tennis players’ success can be explained through strategy, technique, physical conditions, and mental game. While all components contribute to a win, we aim to test the importance of physical conditions by predicting the current rank of a tennis player based on attributes such as height, age, and hand-dominance. We will use these values to answer the predictive question: Can we predict the current rank of an elite tennis player based on the simple attributes of height, age and hand-dominance?

To answer this question we will use Ultimate Tennis Statistics' dataset “player_stats.csv”, which describes the player statistics for the top 500 tennis players worldwide. Each row provides defining characteristics for a specific male tennis player, such as the numeric variables of “Age” and “Height”, and the categorical variables of “Plays” (hand-dominance) and “Current Rank”. The variables of interest range from 16-40 (age), 163-208 cm (height), 1-500 (current rank), and left or right (hand-dominance).
